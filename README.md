# Doodles
Do you remember those spiral notebooks? The ones with the perforated pages that, once ripped out, left this little string of paper? Some of the most creative things came from those little threads, from coloring in the margins. This repository is a place for all the virtual doodles; the creative pieces, those little things that live in the margins and yet somehow feel so significant. Please push, pull, add in your own doodles.
